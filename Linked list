# Linked list with python
# In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical #placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together #represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in #the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. #More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references.
#A linked list can be created by C++ and Pointer, can also be created by python and Node structure
